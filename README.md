Simulation of Insurance Center
Input:  1.dynamic of insurance center
        2.distribution of entrance
        3.distributions of services
here we compare 2 different systems. they differ in dynamics of system and input distribution
as a result of this comparison we would have output of both systems and which system is better than the other,
then we answer the question that why system 2 would be a better choice.
